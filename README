A prototype for a rails log-analyzer. It turns the log into a DSL, similar to cucumber, which is parsed into requests objects that can then be manipulated with plain ruby.

Check config/claruby.yml for example configurations. Configure your counters and paths, then run rake claruby:analyze, and open notes/claruby.html to see the statistics.

Thre's still plenty to do. Off the top of my head:

 #. Add tests. This should have been the first step, but I wasn't sure what kind of interface I wanted to start with. Will be the priority. Begginings are in there
 #. Profile like a mother. Takes much, much, much too long to parse a log. Searching and path generation are acceptable though.
 #. Add cucmber-like syntax for tracking paths and generating daily/hourly reports
 #. Allow users to create their own commands that would be written via logger.info, or logger.debug
